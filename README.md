# Carlos-SVG-Logo-Maker
10 Object-oriented Programming: SVG Logo Maker

## Description

This project involves building a Node.js command-line application that allows users to generate simple logos for their projects. The application prompts the user to input various parameters, including text, text color, shape, and shape color. Based on the user's input, the application generates an SVG file representing the logo and saves it as logo.svg. The user can input up to three characters for the text, choose a color for the text and shape (either by entering a color keyword or a hexadecimal number), and select a shape from a list of options (circle, triangle, or square).

The key functionalities of the application include:

Prompting the user for text, text color, shape, and shape color.
Validating user input to ensure it meets the specified criteria.
Generating an SVG file based on the user's input.
Saving the generated SVG file as logo.svg.
Displaying a success message indicating that the logo has been generated.
Allowing the user to view the generated logo.svg file in a browser, where it should appear as a 300x200 pixel image that matches the input criteria.
Overall, the goal of the project is to provide a simple and user-friendly tool for freelance web developers to create logos for their projects without relying on graphic designers.
